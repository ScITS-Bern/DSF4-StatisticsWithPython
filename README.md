# DSF 4 Statistical data analysis with Python

Statistical inference is the process of deducing properties of an underlying probability distribution (model/theory) by analysis of data. What does it mean when we quantify new measurements, claim findings like discoveries or exclusions of new phenomena? Extracting knowledge from data is about probability and uncertainties. Basic statistical inference knowledge and skills are essential for all professionals dealing with data analysis and interpretation.
This course serves students, researchers and professionals who wish to refresh and deepen their statistical inference skills with a modern peer level approach. Course material is offered as Jupyter notebooks.
The course is part of the block Data Science Funadamentals 1 and 2, but can be attended indiviually. 

Note for CAS Applied Data Science Participants: This course does not provide anything beyond the content of Module 2 (however, may be a nice repitition)
 
### Learning outcomes
- Understand probability and know typical distributions
- Understand the meaning of common characteristics and uncertainties (standard deviations, sigmas, p-values, confidence levels, ...)
- Give and correctly interprete statistical results 
- Apply linear regression for parameter estimation 
- Apply statistical tests

### Target group
