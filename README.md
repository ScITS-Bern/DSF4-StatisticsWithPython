# DSF 4 Statistical data analysis with Python

Statistical inference is the process of deducing properties of an underlying probability distribution (model/theory) by analysis of data. What does it mean when we quantify new measurements, claim findings like discoveries or exclusions of new phenomena? Extracting knowledge from data is about probability and uncertainties. Basic statistical inference knowledge and skills are essential for all professionals dealing with data analysis and interpretation.

This one day course serves students, researchers and professionals who wish to refresh and deepen their statistical inference skills with a modern peer level approach. Course material is offered as Jupyter notebooks.
The course is part of the block Data Science Funadamentals 1 and 2, but can be attended indiviually. 

Note for CAS Applied Data Science Participants: This course does not provide anything beyond the content of Module 2 (however, may be a nice repitition)
 
### Learning outcomes
- Understand probability and know typical distributions
- Understand the meaning of common characteristics and uncertainties (standard deviations, sigmas, p-values, confidence levels, ...)
- Give and correctly interprete statistical results 
- Apply linear regression for parameter estimation 
- Apply statistical tests

### Target group
- Students, researchers and professionals working with data

### Prerequisites
- Equivalent to Data Science Fundamentals 1, 2 and 3.
- Basic programming skills are necessary, we don't reserve time for basic programming concepts.

### Methods
- Course languages are Python and English
- Short theory sessions followed by hands-on tutorials with Jupyter notebooks 

### Certificate and points
- Certificate of attendance.
- Participants attending  DSF 4-5 are offered to make a project (30 hours). Upon a successful presentation 2 ECTS credit points are given. 

### Coaches
- The coaches are local and external experts

## Practical Information 
Time : 2020.06.11 from 09:00 to 17:00 <br>
Location : Online and ...
Online Room: 

### How to run the notebooks - there are at least 3 ways:
- Upload and run them on google colab (google account needed)
- Upload and run them from noto.epfl.ch (AAI/campus account needed)
- Run them locally (jupyter needs to be installed)

For remote attendance, it is very helpful to have two screens, one for Zoom and one for your notebook.<br>
